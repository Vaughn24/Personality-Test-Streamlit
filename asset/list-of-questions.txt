I would be quite bored by a visit to an art gallery.
I clean my office or home quite frequently.
I rarely hold a grudge, even against people who have badly wronged me.
I feel reasonably satisfied with myself overall.
I would feel afraid if I had to travel in bad weather conditions.
If I want something from a person I dislike, I will act very nicely toward that person in order to get it.
I'm interested in learning about the history and politics of other countries.
When working, I often set ambitious goals for myself.
People sometimes tell me that I am too critical of others.
I rarely express my opinions in group meetings.
